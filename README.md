# GratitudeDiaryApp

### Incomplete Project 
__Important__: Unfortunately, this project was never complete as the we never received the endpoint so I wasn't able to connect the frontend to the backend. 

### App Tagline
This app is a gratitude journal, where user input 3 things they are grateful for everyday. They can look at past journals and see what other friends are on the platform.

### Screenshots
Some screenshots of your app (highlight important features)

#### Description
This app has 3 pages, the Archives, Journal, and Friends page. On the Archives page it list old journal entries and past gratitudes from your friends and yourself. On the Journal page it includes 3 default input you can post. You can add or substract the amount of post you want to add. After you input your thoughts, you click the post button and it updates the archives page. The friends page has a record of your other friends that are on the app. You can also delete friends by pressing the "X" button
